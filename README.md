### This project is very much a WIP. The dat format, headers and content are subject to change until the initial release is published. Use at your own risk.

**ENTrimmed** is a curated DAT collection project focused on building clean, consistent, and practical ROM sets for retro game systems. It emphasizes English-speaking region preference, retail-only games, and a strict 1G1R (1 Game 1 ROM) format. The goal is to produce ROM libraries that are ready to play and free from clutter.

---

## Project Goals

- Remove hacks, prototypes, homebrew, aftermarket releases, and other non-retail ROMs.
- Prioritize English-speaking regions.
- 1G1R Format.
- Built from official DAT sources (No-Intro, Redump).
- Compatible with ROMVault, ClrMamePro, and other DAT managers.

## Tools Used

ENTrimmed uses open-source, community-trusted tools for building and verifying sets:

- [**Retool**](https://github.com/unexpectedpanda/retool) – For generating 1G1R trimmed DATs
- [**ROMVault**](https://www.romvault.com/) – For scanning, fixing, and validating
- [**SabreTools**](https://github.com/SabreTools/SabreTools) – For DAT creation
- [**DATVault**](https://www.datvault.com/) – For sourcing No-Intro, Redump and T-En DATs
- Custom scripts (WIP)

## How to Use

1. Download the `.dat` file for your system of choice.
2. Load it into your preferred ROM manager.
3. Scan your ROM collection.
4. Fix any mismatches or missing files.
5. Enjoy a clean, verified set!

## Naming & Structure

ENTrimmed DATs follow a consistent naming convention:

[System] (1G1R, English, Retail + T-en) [ENTrimmed vX.X].dat

Each set includes:
- 1G1R trimmed entries
- English region preference
- T-En patched games where applicable
- Exclusions: hacks, betas, demos, homebrew, aftermarket
