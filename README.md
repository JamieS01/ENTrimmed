### This project is a WIP. The dat format, headers and content are subject to change until the initial release is published. Use at your own risk.

**ENTrimmed** is a curated DAT collection project focused on building practical ROM sets for retro gamers. It emphasizes English-speaking region preference, retail-only games, and a strict 1G1R (1 Game 1 ROM) format. The goal is to produce ROM libraries that are ready to play and free from clutter.

---

## Project Goals

- Remove hacks, prototypes, homebrew, aftermarket releases, and other non-retail ROMs.
- Prioritize English-speaking regions.
- 1G1R Format.
- Built from official DAT sources (No-Intro, Redump).
- Compatible with ROMVault, ClrMamePro, and other DAT managers.

## Planned Releases

Here are the systems I intend to include in the initial release of the dats. The initial release will not include entries from the T-En dats, as filtering these into a 1G1R set is a rather subjective process that requires careful consideration.
